## Summary

This is my submission for the 5th FEND Project. The goal was to test a given feedreader with the testing library Jasmine. My task was to write the testing specifications in the feedreader.js file.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository or download the files as a .zip. No other installations are required.

To start the test, unzip the files, open the file direcotry and open index.html in your web browser.

That's it youâ€™re ready to start testing!

## Features

 * Ensure that the url and name of the feeds is defined.
 * Test that the menu is hidden by default and changes it's state when the menu button is clicked.
 * Ensure that the feed contains atleast one entry.
 * Make sure that the content changes when the feed is changed.
